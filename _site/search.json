It will also require an understanding of how local governments and the constellations of interlocal mechanisms that operate at the substate level function as resources are deployed. Scholars often consider special districts, regional public sector organizations, interlocal agreements, and other collective action mechanisms in isolation. While developing a rigorous understanding of the components requires narrow focus, the larger network is not nearly as siloed.\nThe Build Back Better bill focusing on human infrastructure–in whatever final resulting form—will rely on many of the same overlapping constellations of local governments and interlocal mechanisms, as well as partnerships with civic sector providers. The governance and implementation of programs through Area Agencies on Aging, multijurisdictional opioid addiction response partnerships, watershed coalitions, and educational partnerships operate within some of these same regional public sector organizations. The special districts and interlocal agreements impacted by investments in human infrastructure may involve many of the same local government and civic sector partners as the physical infrastructure investments. Our panelists will discuss ongoing governance research focused on four areas central to physical and human infrastructure needs in the U.S.: water systems management, broadband deployment, behavioral health care, and sustainability planning. Each panelist applies different research techniques to capture these questions: network analysis, individual case study, interview data analysis, and survey data analysis.\n\n\nKate Albrecht, University of Illinois-Chicago (presenter) Thomas Skuzinski, Northern Illinois University Jason Michnick, University of Illinois-Chicago Carolina Velandia Hernandez, Northern Illinois University\n\n\n\nJay Rickabaugh, Appalachian State University (presenter, confirmed) Jen Luetkemeyer, Appalachian State University\n\n\n\nSapna Varkey, University of Missouri-Saint Louis (presenter) Kara Lawrence, North Carolina State University Leila Chelbi, North Carolina State University Amanda J.

As such, to honor his legacy to the section and to the field, we will dedicate an hour of the day to an open conversation among attendees about their research in progress. Attendees are invited to share about current research, their future ideas, any stumbling blocks they may be grappling with on their projects, and other topics related to federalism, intergovernmental relations, intergovernmental management, or general professional development in the field.\n\n\n\n12:15-1:30PM\n\n\n\n1:30–3:00PM\n\n\nUlrich Jensen, Akheil Singla, Justin Stritch, and David Swindell, Arizona State University\nPublic health services in the United States are collaboratively provided by all levels of U.S. governments, creating a complicated and often conflicted policy environment during a pandemic like COVID-19. When facing poor-COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., high case and death rates), elected officials can deflect blame up or down the vertical hierarchy of government instead of accepting responsibility. The result may worsen intergovernmental service delivery and result in an erosion of accountability and trust among citizens. To explore whether such blame shifting occurs, we manipulated the saliency of states’ relative performance on central COVID-19 outcomes as part of a survey experiment among 339 political decision makers serving on city councils across the United States. Drawing on the concept of “negativity bias,” we show that elected officials are highly motivated to shift blame to external factors instead of assuming responsibility when poor performance is made salient. Elected officials in better-performing states, however, do not claim credit for lower COVID-19 case and fatality rates, supporting the notion that political leaders place disproportionate weight on negative information when attributing responsibility for policy outcomes. Our findings have extensive ramifications, as failure to assume responsibility when it is needed the most can further erode citizen trust in public institutions and exacerbate resistance to the very public health measures prescribed by these institutions to combat COVID-19.\n\n\n\nSeungkyu Choi, Michelle Allgood (Presenter), and David Swindell, Arizona State University\nCOVID-19 not only sparked a public health crisis, but created a series of policy preemption battles. This article examines how COVID-19 interventions played out at the state level given the absence of guidance to create a coordinated national response. Specifically, we examine how four specific interventions (i.e., masking, school closures, restaurant closures, and travel restrictions) traveled through the policy creation and implementation process as outlined by a modified version of Kingdon’s multiple streams approach. We focus on how the level of policy rigidness and enforcement of behavioral interventions helps us understand the success and failures of reducing the number of positive test rates over a 20 week period (March – July, 2020). Our findings suggest that highly restrictive policies are effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19, but the mechanisms and dynamics vary based on the specific intervention. We also find a strong association between the states’ political orientation and a governor’s inclination to use restrictive interventions. Governors from conservative states are less likely to employ preemptive actions such as face mask regulations and travel restrictions and more likely to preempt local governments from exceeding state-specified responses.\n\n\n\nChris Hawkins, University of Central Florida\nSustainability has become an umbrella concept under which urban environmental quality, resource conservation, equity, climate mitigation, economic health and environmental justice all occur. As such, research has sought to gain a deeper understanding of how cities are pursuing these and other objectives. To this end, a relatively large scholarly literature has emerged on city sustainability policies and programmatic efforts. However, how city officials define sustainability is also critical; such conceptualizations reflects the city’s sustainability agenda and guide the city’s operationalization of sustainability objectives.\nThis study uses a unique collection of qualitative data from over 400 US cities collected at two points in time: 2015 and 2020. Specifically, local government staff with sustainability-related responsibilities provided open-ended descriptions of sustainability as it is practiced in their communities. We develop and apply a coding protocol to the definitions in order to assess patterns and generate groupings of similar cities. We present descriptive statistics illustrating how cities’ conceptualizations of sustainability have shifted over time and present the results of a multivariate analysis that differentiate groups of cities based on community characteristics.\nPreliminary results suggest that although some cities define sustainability in relatively comprehensive terms and reflect a future oriented perspective, other cities define sustainability more programmatically. Results also point toward the challenges of pursuing sustainability without generating co-benefits, a lack of political support, and limited resources. These and other findings add new evidence of how sustainability is practiced and the similarities and differences across cities.\n\n\n\n\n3:00PM\n\n\n\n5:00PM"

It will also require an understanding of how local governments and the constellations of interlocal mechanisms that operate at the substate level function as resources are deployed. Scholars often consider special districts, regional public sector organizations, interlocal agreements, and other collective action mechanisms in isolation. While developing a rigorous understanding of the components requires narrow focus, the larger network is not nearly as siloed.\nThe Build Back Better bill focusing on human infrastructure–in whatever final resulting form—will rely on many of the same overlapping constellations of local governments and interlocal mechanisms, as well as partnerships with civic sector providers. The governance and implementation of programs through Area Agencies on Aging, multijurisdictional opioid addiction response partnerships, watershed coalitions, and educational partnerships operate within some of these same regional public sector organizations. The special districts and interlocal agreements impacted by investments in human infrastructure may involve many of the same local government and civic sector partners as the physical infrastructure investments. Our panelists will discuss ongoing governance research focused on four areas central to physical and human infrastructure needs in the U.S.: water systems management, broadband deployment, behavioral health care, and sustainability planning. Each panelist applies different research techniques to capture these questions: network analysis, individual case study, interview data analysis, and survey data analysis.\n\n\nKate Albrecht, University of Illinois-Chicago (presenter) Thomas Skuzinski, Northern Illinois University Jason Michnick, University of Illinois-Chicago Carolina Velandia Hernandez, Northern Illinois University\n\n\n\nJay Rickabaugh, Appalachian State University (presenter, confirmed) Jen Luetkemeyer, Appalachian State University\n\n\n\nSapna Varkey, University of Missouri-Saint Louis (presenter) Kara Lawrence, North Carolina State University Leila Chelbi, North Carolina State University Amanda J. Stewart, North Carolina State University Richard M. Clerkin, North Carolina State University\n\n\n\nThomas Skuzinski, Northern Illinois University\n\n\n\n\n11:00-11:15\n\n\n\n11:15-12:15\nProfessor Deil Wright was a true master of mentorship and research collaboration. As such, to honor his legacy to the section and to the field, we will dedicate an hour of the day to an open conversation among attendees about their research in progress. Attendees are invited to share about current research, their future ideas, any stumbling blocks they may be grappling with on their projects, and other topics related to federalism, intergovernmental relations, intergovernmental management, or general professional development in the field.\n\n\n\n12:15-1:30PM\n\n\n\n1:30–3:00PM\n\n\nUlrich Jensen, Akheil Singla, Justin Stritch, and David Swindell, Arizona State University\nPublic health services in the United States are collaboratively provided by all levels of U.S. governments, creating a complicated and often conflicted policy environment during a pandemic like COVID-19. When facing poor-COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., high case and death rates), elected officials can deflect blame up or down the vertical hierarchy of government instead of accepting responsibility. The result may worsen intergovernmental service delivery and result in an erosion of accountability and trust among citizens. To explore whether such blame shifting occurs, we manipulated the saliency of states’ relative performance on central COVID-19 outcomes as part of a survey experiment among 339 political decision makers serving on city councils across the United States. Drawing on the concept of “negativity bias,” we show that elected officials are highly motivated to shift blame to external factors instead of assuming responsibility when poor performance is made salient. Elected officials in better-performing states, however, do not claim credit for lower COVID-19 case and fatality rates, supporting the notion that political leaders place disproportionate weight on negative information when attributing responsibility for policy outcomes. Our findings have extensive ramifications, as failure to assume responsibility when it is needed the most can further erode citizen trust in public institutions and exacerbate resistance to the very public health measures prescribed by these institutions to combat COVID-19.\n\n\n\nSeungkyu Choi, Michelle Allgood (Presenter), and David Swindell, Arizona State University\nCOVID-19 not only sparked a public health crisis, but created a series of policy preemption battles. This article examines how COVID-19 interventions played out at the state level given the absence of guidance to create a coordinated national response. Specifically, we examine how four specific interventions (i.e., masking, school closures, restaurant closures, and travel restrictions) traveled through the policy creation and implementation process as outlined by a modified version of Kingdon’s multiple streams approach. We focus on how the level of policy rigidness and enforcement of behavioral interventions helps us understand the success and failures of reducing the number of positive test rates over a 20 week period (March – July, 2020). Our findings suggest that highly restrictive policies are effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19, but the mechanisms and dynamics vary based on the specific intervention. We also find a strong association between the states’ political orientation and a governor’s inclination to use restrictive interventions. Governors from conservative states are less likely to employ preemptive actions such as face mask regulations and travel restrictions and more likely to preempt local governments from exceeding state-specified responses.\n\n\n\nChris Hawkins, University of Central Florida\nSustainability has become an umbrella concept under which urban environmental quality, resource conservation, equity, climate mitigation, economic health and environmental justice all occur. As such, research has sought to gain a deeper understanding of how cities are pursuing these and other objectives. To this end, a relatively large scholarly literature has emerged on city sustainability policies and programmatic efforts. However, how city officials define sustainability is also critical; such conceptualizations reflects the city’s sustainability agenda and guide the city’s operationalization of sustainability objectives.\nThis study uses a unique collection of qualitative data from over 400 US cities collected at two points in time: 2015 and 2020. Specifically, local government staff with sustainability-related responsibilities provided open-ended descriptions of sustainability as it is practiced in their communities. We develop and apply a coding protocol to the definitions in order to assess patterns and generate groupings of similar cities. We present descriptive statistics illustrating how cities’ conceptualizations of sustainability have shifted over time and present the results of a multivariate analysis that differentiate groups of cities based on community characteristics.\nPreliminary results suggest that although some cities define sustainability in relatively comprehensive terms and reflect a future oriented perspective, other cities define sustainability more programmatically. Results also point toward the challenges of pursuing sustainability without generating co-benefits, a lack of political support, and limited resources. These and other findings add new evidence of how sustainability is practiced and the similarities and differences across cities.\n\n\n\n\n3:00PM\n\n\n\n5:00PM"

Wright Symposium. The symposium honors the career and contributions of Professor Deil S. Wright, who was a charter member of the Section and remained active until his passing in 2009. The Wright Symposium will be a preconference event held on Friday, March 17, 2017 at the national conference of the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) in Atlanta, Georgia.\nThe theme of the all-day symposium is “Evidence-Based Intergovernmental Management: Knowledge at Work.” It will focus on U.S. federalism and comparative federalism. Through decades of research on federalism and intergovernmental relations, public administration scholars have generated knowledge about effective governance and management in federal systems. While the cumulative lessons of this research may be familiar to some, they have not been discussed widely by scholars or used by professional public managers. Today, public officials are expected to take evidence-based approaches to policy design and implementation, and the record of research evidence about what has worked and what has failed to produce desired results would be an invaluable resource. Scholars of federalism, intergovernmental relations, intergovernmental management, and collaborative management can help improve federal systems by providing meta-analyses and synthesizing evidence in the field to inform practice. The 2017 Wright Symposium provides an excellent forum for doing so.\nProposed paper topics are invited that would help scholars and government professionals better understand what we have learned from the cumulative research on intergovernmental relations and management. Papers are welcome to advance new research propositions, identify research gaps, or provide empirical evidence. The goal is to emphasize for public managers how evidence can be used to shape intergovernmental management practice. Topics might include, but are not limited to the:\n\nDesign, accountability, and evaluation of intergovernmental grants and programs, including revenue sharing and fiscal equalization;\nDevelopment of collaborative intergovernmental competencies or skills by federal, regional, state, and local public managers;\nEffectiveness of elected executives in managing intergovernmental relations in presidential and parliamentary federal systems;\nEffectiveness of intergovernmental, interjurisdictional, and intersectoral management networks;\nValue of intergovernmental institutions, such as the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, Council of Australian Governments, or the White House Office on Intergovernmental Affairs;\nImpact of federalism executive orders or presidential decrees on intergovernmetal relations;\nImpacts of federal mandates and conditions attached to federal grants-in-aid;\nEffectiveness of regulatory waivers;\nDiffusion of evidence-based practices horizontally across constituent units such as states, provinces, and cantons;\nPerformance of regional governments and organizations, such as consolidated or amalgamated local governments, metropolitan governments, councils of governments, and city-states;\nAdvantages and disadvantages of optional forms of local government;\nConsequences of litigation for the authority of public managers in intergovernmental programs;\nImpacts of court orders, consent decrees, and other judicial interventions into intergovernmental relations.\n\nProposals for the symposium should be submitted by email to Carl Stenberg (stenberg@sog.unc.edu) before October 1. Proposals should be well developed and clearly demonstrate the ability to deliver a finished paper. The Wright Symposium planning committee – Ann Bowman, John Kincaid, Michael McGuire, Eric Zeemering, and Carl Stenberg — will review proposals and make decisions by October 22. Questions can be directed to committee members. Please circulate this call for papers among interested colleagues."

The Wright Symposium will be a preconference event held on Friday, March 9, 2018 at the national conference of the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) in Denver, Colorado.\nThe 2018 symposium will explore state-local relations in the United States. Wright’s classic textbook Understanding Intergovernmental Relations acknowledged the importance of state-local relations within our federal system. Wright commented on many dimensions of this relationship including local boundaries and systems of governance, revenue systems, mandates and regulation, and administrative coordination. State-local relations are sometimes characterized by conflict, sometimes in competition, but often through partnership and collaboration. The 2018 Wright Symposium will feature empirical studies that provide insight into the character, quality and variety of state-local relations today. The Symposium seeks proposals on all aspects of state-local relations. Questions to engage may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nTo what extent are today’s state-local relations characterized by conflict, competition, cooperation, or something else?\nWhat explains variation in the character of state-local relations across states and across policies, and is the pattern of variation changing?\nWhat is the future for emergency manager laws and state take-overs of local governments and services, e.g. education?\nHow has political polarization affected state preemption of local authority in different policy areas, and what explains variation in local authority across the states?\nWhat should public managers learn from recent failures, e.g. the crisis in Flint, Michigan, and successes in state-local relations?\nWhat approaches are states taking steps to foster local innovation and experimentation in economic development, education, environmental policy, social policy, or other fields?\nIn what ways are states engaging in new forms of cooperation with local governments and metropolitan regions to advance job training and economic development?\nAs the federal regulatory climate shifts, how are different states responding and what are the consequences for their interactions with local governments?\nIn which policy areas is Republican control of the national government most likely to result in new devolutions to the states, and perhaps second-order devolution to local governments?\nIs the current structure of administrator and elected official involvement in intergovernmental relations similar to that described by Deil Wright in 1990, or have patterns of intergovernmental relations changed with the evolving importance of policy networks?\n\nThe Deil S. Wright Symposium has become a premier venue for sharing intergovernmental relations research. Proposals should explain how the author(s) advance our theoretical understanding of state-local relations and federal systems. Successful proposal will seek insight through new data, path-breaking methods, and critical questioning of existing knowledge.\nThe organizers of the 2018 Wright Symposium intend to prepare an edited volume based upon the symposium theme. Papers from the symposium may be included after careful peer review. Submit your proposal before August 1, 2017. Proposals should be sent by email to Russ Hanson (hansonr@indiana.edu) and Eric Zeemering (zeem@niu.edu). The proposal should include contact information for all authors, the paper title, a proposal of 500 words or less, and an explanation of how the research relates to the theme outlined in this call for papers. For accepted proposals, complete draft papers for the symposium should be submitted by January 1, 2018. The editors will review the work and provide feedback before the symposium. This will also provide an opportunity to solicit discussants for the symposium sessions. We look forward to your participation in the 2018 Deil S. Wright Symposium at the ASPA Conference."
