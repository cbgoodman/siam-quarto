The **Section on Intergovernmental Administration and Management** invites scholars and practitioners to submit proposals for papers to be presented at the 8th annual Deil S. Wright Symposium. The symposium honors the career and contributions of Professor Deil S. Wright, who was a charter member of the Section and remained active until his passing in 2009. The Wright Symposium will be held at the national conference of the American Society for Public Administration in Jacksonville, FL.  The date is still being finalized, but it is typically the day before the conference begins.  The theme of the all-day 2022 Wright Symposium will be “Intergovernmental Issues of the Biden Presidency.” 

### Submission Guidelines

**Individual Paper Proposals.**  The committee welcomes individual paper proposals of 400 words or less. Proposed papers should feature high-quality theoretical, qualitative, or quantitative research.  Proposals should make their connection to the symposium theme direct and clear.  

**Full Panel Proposals.**  The committee also welcomes the submission of complete panels consisting of four papers and a chair.  Panel submissions should bring together complementary papers that tackle compelling research questions or theoretical frameworks related to the symposium theme.

Panel proposals should include a panel title and description (400 words or less), the panel chair, and four individual paper proposals (400 words or less each). Each paper proposal will be evaluated separately on whether it meets the criteria for individual paper submissions.

Panel chairs are encouraged to incorporate diverse participants in panels, whether in gender, race, institution, rank, disciplinary perspective, or methodology.

The program committee may alter panels to remove individual papers that do not meet review criteria or to add an individual paper submission that fits well with the panel, particularly if dropouts occur. The program committee plans to do so sparingly.

### Submission Process

Proposals for the symposium should be submitted by email to Christine Palus ([christine.palus@villanova.edu](mailto:christine.palus@villanova.edu)) before November 13, 2021.  The Wright Symposium planning committee – Christine Palus (Villanova University), Chris Hawkins (University of Central Florida), and David Swindell (Arizona State University), will review proposals and make decisions by December 1, 2021.  Questions can be directed to committee members.  *Please circulate this call for papers among interested colleagues.*
