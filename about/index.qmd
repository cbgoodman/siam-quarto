SIAM is the Section on Intergovernment Administration and Management, a section of the [American Society for Public Administration (ASPA)](https://www.aspanet.org). The Section serves as a forum for the study, understanding, and improvement of federal systems and other forms of intergovernmental relations wherein national, state, and local governments address policy and management issues.
