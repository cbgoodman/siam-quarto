Proposed papers should feature high-quality theoretical, qualitative, or quantitative research.  Proposals should make their connection to the symposium theme direct and clear.  \n\n**Full Panel Proposals.**  The committee also welcomes the submission of complete panels consisting of four papers and a chair.  Panel submissions should bring together complementary papers that tackle compelling research questions or theoretical frameworks related to the symposium theme.\n\nPanel proposals should include a panel title and description (400 words or less), the panel chair, and four individual paper proposals (400 words or less each). Each paper proposal will be evaluated separately on whether it meets the criteria for individual paper submissions.\n\nPanel chairs are encouraged to incorporate diverse participants in panels, whether in gender, race, institution, rank, disciplinary perspective, or methodology.\n\nThe program committee may alter panels to remove individual papers that do not meet review criteria or to add an individual paper submission that fits well with the panel, particularly if dropouts occur. The program committee plans to do so sparingly.\n\n### Submission Process\n\nProposals for the symposium should be submitted by email to Christine Palus ([christine.palus@villanova.edu](mailto:christine.palus@villanova.edu)) before November 13, 2021.  The Wright Symposium planning committee – Christine Palus (Villanova University), Chris Hawkins (University of Central Florida), and David Swindell (Arizona State University), will review proposals and make decisions by December 1, 2021.  Questions can be directed to committee members.  *Please circulate this call for papers among interested colleagues.*\n\n![President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, joined by the Presidential Cabinet members, pose for a Cabinet portrait Thursday, April 1, 2021, in the Grand Foyer of the White House.
